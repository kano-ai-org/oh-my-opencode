Incomplete tasks remain in your todo list. Continue working on the next pending task.

- Proceed only while actionable todo items remain and measurable progress can be made
- Mark each task complete when finished
- If blocked by external tools, verifier timeout, missing verdict output, access limits, or required user input, document the blocker and stop instead of retrying forever
- If you believe all work is already complete, critically re-examine each todo item, verify the work was actually done correctly, and update the todo list accordingly.`
